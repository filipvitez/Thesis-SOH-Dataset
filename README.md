# Thesis: Predicting Lithium Ion BatteryCell Quality Indicators

This repository is a part of a thesis work carried out at LTH and Northvolt. In the repository, some of the methodology tried in the thesis is evaluated on a synthetic dataset, unrelated to Northvolt.

`SoC_estimation.ipynb` is a notebook containing the code for:
- Exploring the dataset
- Creating a 2D latent space representation of the feature space using UMAP
- Training and evaluating a Catboost regressor using cross validation and several evaluation metrics.

The dataset exists in 
`/Data`
